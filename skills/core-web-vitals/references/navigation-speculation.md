# Measured navigation speculation

For sites with predictable same-origin journeys, prerendering a likely next page can make a successful subsequent navigation much faster. Treat this as a measured navigation optimization, not a substitute for fixing the current page's LCP.

```html
<script type="speculationrules">
{
  "prerender": [{
    "where": { "href_matches": "/*" },
    "eagerness": "moderate"
  }]
}
</script>
```

Current Chrome behavior is specific enough to guide the choice:

| `eagerness` | Trigger |
|-------------|---------|
| `conservative` | Pointer or touch down |
| `moderate` | Desktop: 200ms hover, or earlier pointer down; mobile: viewport heuristics |
| `eager` | Chrome 143+: desktop 10ms hover; mobile 50ms after the anchor enters the viewport |
| `immediate` | As soon as the rules are observed |

Start conservatively and measure prediction hit rate, transferred bytes, server load, and navigation improvement before expanding the rules. Recheck [Chrome's maintained eagerness documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/prerender-pages#eagerness) before hardcoding timing-sensitive behavior.

Caveats:
- **Bandwidth/CPU cost.** Each prerender is roughly a full page load. Scope `where` carefully (`href_matches` patterns, exclude logout/checkout) and avoid `immediate` outside small sites.
- **Side effects fire early.** Analytics, ads, and any code that runs on load will fire when the prerender starts, not when the user navigates. Gate side effects on the [`prerenderingchange` event](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/prerender-pages#detect_when_a_page_is_prerendered_or_used_for_a_full_navigation) or `document.prerendering`.
- **Engine support.** Verify current support for the exact speculation features used. Keep ordinary navigation functional in unsupported current engines and measure side effects; an optional enhancement can still introduce regressions.
