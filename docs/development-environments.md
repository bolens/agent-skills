# Development environments

Install [Nix and devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/), then run from this checkout:

```sh
devenv shell
repo-check
# Or run the same portable gate non-interactively:
devenv test
```

The shell supplies Python, Node.js, Bash, Git, Make, ShellCheck, and common text utilities. `repo-check` calls `make check-fast test portability`. Installed skill links belong to the canonical checkout; development containers do not install or repoint them. The separate Archify browser workspace remains an explicit `make test-archify` operation.

Commit `devenv.lock` with deliberate input updates. Local state and `devenv.local.nix` / `devenv.local.yaml` overrides are ignored. Existing Nix cache settings are used without changing daemon trust.

## Docker and Podman

Build and load the development image, then run a command with a local engine:

```sh
python3 scripts/development-container.py build podman
python3 scripts/development-container.py run podman -- make check-fast test portability
# Substitute docker for podman to use Docker.
```

Omit the command for an interactive Bash shell. The helper mounts the checkout at `/workspace`, runs with the caller's UID/GID, and uses Podman's keep-id mapping. It forwards arguments and exit status without constructing a shell command. These mounts require a local engine with access to the checkout path; remote Docker daemons need their own source transfer. Paths containing commas are rejected because they cannot be represented by this mount syntax.

The image contains tools, not checkout files. Build archives live under `.devenv/containers/` and are never uploaded by the helper. Existing production images and Compose stacks are separate from this development image.

## Apple container

[Apple container](https://github.com/apple/container) requires a supported Apple-silicon Mac. Start its runtime according to Apple's installation guide. With a Linux Nix builder configured:

```sh
python3 scripts/development-container.py build apple
python3 scripts/development-container.py run apple -- make check-fast test portability
```

The helper exports an OCI archive and uses `container image load`. Native ARM Macs target `aarch64-linux`; x86 Linux builds target `x86_64-linux`. [Building Linux images from macOS requires a Linux builder](https://devenv.sh/containers/). This workflow does not assume Apple container implements Docker Compose or Docker's daemon API.

Apple execution is not verified by Linux tests. Native desktop, printer, firewall, and installed-skill behavior still requires its owning host; successful container validation does not establish those capabilities.
